# - Find SDL2 library and headers
# 
# Find module for SDL 2.0 (http://www.libsdl.org/).
# It defines the following variables:
#  SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS - The location of the headers, e.g., SDL.h.
#  SDL2_LIBRARIES - The libraries to link against to use SDL2.
#  SDL2_FOUND - If false, do not try to use SDL2.
#  SDL2_VERSION_STRING - Human-readable string containing the version of SDL2.
#
# This module responds to the the flag:
#  SDL2_BUILDING_LIBRARY
#    If this is defined, then no SDL2_main will be linked in because
#    only applications need main().
#    Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
#    module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link flags
#    as part of the returned SDL2_LIBRARIES variable.
#
# Also defined, but not for general use are:
#   SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR - The directory that contains SDL.h.
#   SDL2_LIBRARY - The location of the SDL2 library.
#   SDL2MAIN_LIBRARY - The location of the SDL2main library.
